I'm creating this project as a part of my graduate program at Aalborg University.
The study regulation for the programme can be found [here](https://studieordninger.aau.dk/2020/23/1819).

## Theme: Mobility
[The project theme](https://moduler.aau.dk/course/2020-2021/DSNSWK210?lang=en-GB) is focused on _mobility_, or using equipment which allows the user to move around and be mobile.
This can be contrasted against static services, which aren't ideal for many situations.
