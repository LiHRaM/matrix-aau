\section{Introduction}
% 1. How safe is chat, really? Who is the middle man? Why should we trust them?
%     - Consider from both private and enterprise perspectives.
% 2. One way to mitigate this threat? Use state of the art encryption, such as Signal, ProtonMail, etc?
% 3. Another way to mitigate the thread is to federate the communication, i.e. spread the middle men across servers.
% 4. Where is the balance between convenience and security.
% 5. Consider recent laws, GDPR, California Act, etc. - Users deserve control over their data, where it is stored, etc. We want to break the monopoly up.
% 6. The Matrix protocol offers "Bridges" to other platforms, allowing users to maintain their other threads, but also providing an independent service. Self hosting is available.
% 7. Implementing peer-to-peer communication would remove any middle man.
% 8. How viable is this? What are properties of a good peer-to-peer solution?
% 9. Consider mobile design. What are the trade-offs?

Internet chatting is an immensely popular activity.
Recently, WhatsApp announced that they have 2 billion users\cite{whatsapp_2b_users_archive_org}.
Similarly, Facebook Messenger has announced having 1.3 billion users\cite{messenger_1pt3b_users}.
Both of these platforms require all participants in a conversation to have copies of the same software, i.e.~WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.
But how safe are these platforms?
Consider for example \cite{digital_comms_protocols_2019}, a survey on different communication protocols.
In terms of security, it is hard to verify the security of closed protocols.
In addition, it is difficult to know what the owners of these proprietary protocols do with the data of their users.
Additionally, having only one proprietary implementation means that all users are equally vulnerable to implementation-specific exploits.
As recently as in 2019, it was reported that a private Israeli entity known as NSO Group has been targeting human-rights activists and journalists via this app\cite{nytimes_nso_group}.



Consider again the comparison in \cite{digital_comms_protocols_2019}.
The highest rated protocol is Matrix\cite{matrix_org}, which is an open standard with various implementations.
