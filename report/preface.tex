\chapter*{Preface}


\section*{\faGithub~Github}
Due to the open nature of the projects that this report considers, referring to repositories, issues, pull requests and branches can become quite repetitive.
In order to make it easier to write and read these references, we use the following shorthand:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{
          \textbf{Repository}: \github{org/repository}\\
          \textit{Before}: https://github.com/lihram/aau\\
          \textit{After}: \github{lihram/aau}
          }
    \item{
          \textbf{Issue or Pull Request}: \github{org/repository\#ID}\\
          \textit{Before}: \url{https://github.com/lihram/aau/pull/1}\\
          \textit{After}: \github{lihram/aau\#1}\\
          Several issues or pull requests can be lumped together, with multiple IDs separated by a comma: \github{org/repository\#1,2,3}.
          }
    \item{
          \textbf{Branch}: \github{org/repository/branch}\\
          \textit{Before}: \url{https://github.com/LiHRaM/aau/tree/gh-pages}\\
          \textit{After}: \github{lihram/aau/gh-pages}
          }
\end{itemize}
