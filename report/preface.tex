\section*{\faGithub~Github}
Due to the open nature of the projects that this report considers, referring to repositories, issues and pull requests can become quite repetitive.
In order to make it easier to write and read these references, we refer to GitHub issues and pull requests in the following manner: \github{org/repository\#ID}, where ID is a number identifying the issue.
We refer to repositories simply as \github{org/repository}.
For example, for the pull request at \url{https://github.com/lihram/aau/pull/1}, we write: \github{lihram/aau\#1}.
Referring to multiple issues or pull requests is done similarly, \github{lihram/aau\#1,2}.
