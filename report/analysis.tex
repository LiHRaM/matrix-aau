\section{Analysis}
We explore the different questions posed in the initial problem statement in section \ref{subsec:initial_problem_statement}

\subsection{The Silo Problem}
The Silo problem is...

% \subsection{Matrix}
% The highest rated protocol is Matrix\cite{matrix_org}, which is an open standard with various implementations\cite{matrix_org_clients, matrix_org_sdks}.
% It is designed to work similarly to the email standard, in the sense that users with separate providers may communicate with each other.
% However, this prevents users from being truly mobile, in the sense that they are stuck with their current provider, or, at the very least, run their own server with a static IP address and a DNS entry.
% The Matrix development repository has an open issue, which suggests implementing a peer-to-peer version, which would allow users to communicate without storing their own account on a separate server\cite{github_matrix_170}.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the architectural consequences and trade-offs in peer-to-peer communication?
    \item What are the properties of a good solution?
    \item How could one implement such a solution?
\end{itemize}
