\section{Analysis}
We explore the different questions posed in the initial problem statement in section \ref{subsec:initial_problem_statement}

\subsection{Use of the Matrix Standard}
\subsection{Matrix Specification Limitations}
\subsection{Matrix Reference Implementation Limitations}
\subsection{Properties of Solutions}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the architectural consequences and trade-offs in peer-to-peer communication?
    \item What are the properties of a good solution?
    \item How could one implement such a solution?
\end{itemize}
