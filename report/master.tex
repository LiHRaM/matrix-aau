\begin{abstract}
	Privacy is becoming harder and harder to maintain as software becomes more intrusive.
	The Matrix standard is an attempt to liberate our communication and privacy through open efforts.
	We investigate the viability of porting Peer-to-Peer Matrix to Android, as a method of improving personal privacy.
	We design and implement an Android application with an embedded Matrix homeserver, and determine that there is an increase of 34\% in app size.
	There is likely to be a significant increase in accumulated message metadata, and \todo{battery impact}.
