\newcommand{\theabstract}{Privacy is becoming harder and harder to maintain as software becomes more intrusive.
The Matrix standard is an attempt to liberate our communication and privacy through open efforts.
We investigate the viability of porting Peer-to-Peer Matrix to Android, as a method of improving personal privacy.
We contribute to the Dendrite open source project, and design and implement modifications to an Android application, such that it also runs a Dendrite server.
The resulting application is capable of communicating via Peer-to-Peer networking, and is 34\% larger than the unmodified application.
There is likely to be a significant increase in accumulated message metadata.
We determine that it is feasible to run Peer-to-Peer Matrix on Android.
